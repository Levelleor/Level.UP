An idea of community platform to gather collective points called XP and competing with each other in consistency of online actions. Website was supposed to reward users with XP points for visiting unique pages and awarding collective experience to the platform itself. New levels of the platform itself were supposed to tweak the platform visually, thus provide some kind of a reward. 

Project used NodeJS as backend and React as frontend and was designed as a test ground to learn React.
